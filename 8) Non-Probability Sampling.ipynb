    "Non-probability sampling is a technique where samples are drawn from the population without relying on random selection. These methods are often used in exploratory research, pilot studies, or when probability sampling is not feasible due to constraints such as time, cost, or accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike probability sampling, these methods do not allow for precise calculation of sampling error, which can result in biased and unrepresentative findings. However, they are still widely used in fields such as market research, qualitative studies, and in situations where representativeness is not the primary concern.\n"
