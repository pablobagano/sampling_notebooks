    "\n",
    "1. **First Stage**: A large, inexpensive sample is selected, and limited data is collected.\n",
    "2. **Second Stage**: A smaller, more detailed sample is selected from the first stage for comprehensive data collection.\n",

    "- Estimating rare population characteristics.\n",
    "- Reducing costs by limiting detailed surveys to a smaller group.\n",
