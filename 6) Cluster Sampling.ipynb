    "Cluster sampling is a method where the population is divided into groups, known as **clusters**, and a sample of these clusters is selected to represent the population. This method is commonly used when a complete list of the population is unavailable, but natural groups or clusters exist. For example, schools in a district, neighborhoods in a city, or branches of a company.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- The population is divided into **non-overlapping groups** (clusters).\n",
    "- Clusters are selected randomly, and either all elements within selected clusters are surveyed (**one-stage cluster sampling**) or a random sample is taken from within the selected clusters (**two-stage cluster sampling**).\n",
    "- The method assumes clusters are representative of the population as a whole.\n"

    "In one-stage cluster sampling, **all elements** within the randomly selected clusters are included in the sample. This method is suitable when the clusters are internally homogeneous and the cost or effort to survey entire clusters is reasonable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Simplicity, as it avoids additional sampling within clusters.  \n",
    "- **Limitation**: Risk of bias if clusters do not represent the population accurately.\n"
