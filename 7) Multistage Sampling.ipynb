    "\n",
    "Multistage sampling is a complex and flexible method that involves selecting samples in multiple stages. Each stage may use a different sampling method, such as stratified, cluster, or random sampling. This approach is particularly useful for large and geographically dispersed populations, where direct sampling would be inefficient or costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- Involves hierarchical selection processes, breaking the population into progressively smaller units.\n",
    "- Combines multiple sampling methods to adapt to the structure of the population.\n",
    "- Reduces logistical challenges while maintaining representativeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "A national educational survey might:\n",
    "1. Divide the population by state (stage 1: stratified sampling).  \n",
    "2. Select school districts within each state (stage 2: cluster sampling).  \n",
    "3. Sample individual students within selected districts (stage 3: simple random sampling).\n"

    "### Advantages:\n",
    "1. **Cost-Effective**: Reduces the effort and expense of sampling large populations.  \n",
    "2. **Flexibility**: Allows for different methods at each stage, tailored to population characteristics.  \n",
    "3. **Scalability**: Suitable for large-scale surveys with limited resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "1. **Cumulative Errors**: Errors from each stage may combine, reducing precision.  \n",
    "2. **Complexity**: Requires careful planning to avoid bias and ensure accuracy.  \n",
    "3. **Dependence on Accurate Hierarchical Data**: Assumes a well-defined population structure.\n"

    "4. **Select Units at Each Stage**: Apply the chosen sampling methods sequentially.  \n",
    "5. **Collect Data**: Conduct the study using the final sample.\n"
