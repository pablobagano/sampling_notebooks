    "Cohen's $d$ is a standardized measure that quantifies the magnitude of the difference between two means. It is widely used in hypothesis testing, particularly for determining effect sizes in A/B testing and other experimental designs. It provides a scale-free way to interpret the strength of a difference, making results comparable across studies.\n",

    "- $ \\overline{X}_1, \\overline{X}_2 $: Mean values of the two groups being compared.\n",
    "- $ \\sigma $: Pooled standard deviation of the population, which represents the variability across both groups.\n",

    "Effect sizes are categorized into levels based on the $d$ value:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Why Cohen's $d$ Matters in A/B Testing:\n",
    "- **Context of the Test:** Cohen's $d$ helps define the minimum detectable effect (MDE), which determines the smallest effect size that the experiment is designed to detect.  \n",
